# Shipping Application

## Overview

This project is a shipping application built using ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJS with Sequelize ORM for the backend. The main objective of this app is to provide an intuitive and responsive interface for managing shipments. It showcases my skills in both frontend and backend development, particularly in creating dynamic user interfaces, managing state in React, and implementing robust backend services.

## Features

- **React Essentials**: The project demonstrates key React concepts including:
  - **Components**: Breaking down the UI into reusable, independent pieces.
  - **JSX**: Using JSX syntax to structure the components.
  - **Props**: Passing data between components via props.
  - **State**: Managing component state to handle shipment data and interactions.
- **Shipment Management**: 
  - **Create Shipment**: Add new shipments through a modal form.
  - **Update Shipment**: Edit existing shipment details.
  - **Delete Shipment**: Remove shipments from the list.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application is accessible and usable on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **ReactJS**: Used for building the frontend components and managing state.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for styling the app interface.
- **Backend**:
  - **NodeJS**: Used for the backend server.
  - **Sequelize ORM**: Used for database interactions.
  - **JWT**: Used for authentication.
